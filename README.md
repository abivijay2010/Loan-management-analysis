ðŸ“Š Loan Management Analysis
This is a complete loan data analysis project where I cleaned, transformed, and visualized a large dataset using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The goal was to understand borrower behavior, loan performance, and risk patterns.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used
Excel â€“ For data cleaning & preprocessing

MySQL â€“ For table creation, joins, stored procedures, and triggers

Power BI â€“ To build interactive dashboards and derive insights

ðŸš€ Project Workflow
Cleaned raw data using Excel â€“ removed duplicates, fixed nulls, and standardized formats

Built relational database using SQL â€“ created loan_analysis, borrowers, and loans tables

Performed analysis queries â€“ segmented risk, studied repayment behavior, and uncovered trends

Created Power BI dashboards â€“ added KPIs, charts, maps, and drill-through visuals for deeper insights

ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
Majority of loans are Fully Paid (~83%) with Charged Off ~14%

Debt Consolidation is the most common purpose

Low-income segments show higher charge-off rates

Recovery rate on charged-off loans is ~0.71%

High loan volumes in states like CA, NY, FL

Grade G recorded the highest recovery rate percentage

ðŸ§  What I Learned
Created a data pipeline from Excel â†’ SQL â†’ Power BI

Wrote SQL with JOINs, GROUP BY, CASE statements, and built stored procedures/triggers

Built interactive dashboards with map visuals, drill-throughs, and detailed segmentation

Improved storytelling through data-driven visual insights
