This is a complete loan data analysis project where I cleaned, transformed, and visualized a large dataset using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The goal was to understand borrower behavior, loan performance, and risk patterns.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used
Excel â€“ For data cleaning & preprocessing

MySQL â€“ For table creation, joins, stored procedures, and triggers

Power BI â€“ To build interactive dashboards and generate insights

ðŸš€ Project Workflow
Cleaned raw data using Excel â€“ removed duplicates, fixed nulls, and standardized formats

Built relational database using SQL â€“ loan_analysis, borrowers, and loans tables

Ran analysis queries â€“ to segment risks, analyze repayment behavior, and detect trends

Created a Power BI dashboard â€“ with KPIs, donut charts, bar charts, maps, and drill-through pages
